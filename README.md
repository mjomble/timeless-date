Right after publishing the first version of this package, I finally found out about the [TC39 Temporal Proposal](https://tc39.es/proposal-temporal/docs/index.html), which includes a [PlainDate class](https://tc39.es/proposal-temporal/docs/plaindate.html) that solves the same problem and will at some point make TimelessDate obsolete.

You can find polyfills [here](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-temporal/tree/main/#polyfills).
